                    </h2>
                    <p>Enduro is a stage-race format where the winner is the rider who accumulates the lowest combined time
                        from the timed downhill sections. Enduros typically take place over one or two days, however, week-long
                        competitions also exist such as the Trans Provence (France), the Andes Pacifico (Chile), and the
                        Pisgah Stage Race (United States). A typical one-day enduro consists of 3 to 5 timed stages which
                        take place on technically demanding, generally descending terrain, and often with sections of singletrack.
                        These stages are linked by predominantly ascending "transfer" stages. Although a rider's performance
                        on the physically demanding transfer stages does not affect his or her result, they often have a
                        time-limit, or a latest allowed arrival-time for the start of the next stage.
                    </p>
                    <p>According to the Enduro World Series 2015 Rule Book, a minimum of four special stages is required
                        per event, a minimum of three different courses must be used, and the results will be calculated
                        by adding all stage times together for each rider.[7] Enduro differs from cross-country (XC) racing
                        which usually has more emphasis on cardiovascular fitness and less emphasis on technical ability,
                        and pure downhill racing, which may contain little to no cross-country or climbing. Enduro's 'All
                        Mountain' discipline therefore favours riders with a breadth of skill, on multi-discipline cycles.
                        Lightweight XC bikes may lack sufficient suspension for fast downhill control, while full downhill
                        bikes may not allow a rider to climb the uphill sections efficiently. In some countries, the term
                        enduro is considered a contraction of "endurance".</p>

                        </h2>
                        <p>After evolving for 4 years in factory teams, I’ve learned a lot and met incredible people along
                            the way, but I always wanted to be more involved in the life of the team. I always had in mind
                            this crazy idea of creating a different structure and to get to know the behind the scenes. When
                            I knew that Kilian and Cédric had the same plan, I made the decision to join them on this new
                            adventure. The fact that I will work directly with the brands will help me to discover a new
                            professional world. The Enduro Collective is the opportunity to work closely with my sponsors.
                        </p>
                        <p>Especially since I graduated with a Master in Marketing, I wanted to get closer to the mountain
                            bike industry. I will mostly work with Mavic to promote their women line. I will also focus on
                            growing a community of women with the same passion for riding with the brand. By choosing this
                            new team and combining my athlete and professional career, I'm preparing for my future. Thus,
                            I am way more calm and ready to enjoy the season. I am happy to team up with Cédric and Kilian.
                            They are longtime friends and a big support for me. Kilian will help me to develop my social
                            media while Cédric will be my main support at every Enduro World Series. My main goal is the
                            Enduro World Series overall title, but besides racing, I I aim to develop a project I created
                            last year, the Ride and Smile days: events for 100% girls! It is a packed program and I am excited
                            for the season to start.</p>

                            In 2003 all eyes were on Thomas Frischknecht as he won the World MTB Marathon Championships. But it wasn’t just the act of
                            winning that was what shock the world, but that he cinched the win on a full-suspension SCOTT
                            Genius with 130 mm of travel. Back then, this bike was a revolution. Now having undergone myriad
                            changes, it’s time to meet the latest iteration: the GENIUS 2018.

                        <p>SCOTT have dominated the cross-country World Cup circuit for the past few years, storming to podium
                            finishes and cementing the brand’s focus on racing. Alongside developing the hugely successful
                            Spark model alongside pro rider Nino Schurter, a ton of the same expertise has been threaded
                            into the new Genius. The result is a lightweight trail bike (the frame weighs 2,249 g including
                            shock and hardware), which has the brand’s well-known TWIN LOC technology with its three positions,
                            meaning it’s a stellar climber and a ripping descender in one.</p>
